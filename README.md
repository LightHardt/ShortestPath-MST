# Project Topic: Shortest Paths and Minimum Spanning Trees

In this project, you implemented the A* heuristic variation of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm and Prim’s minimum spanning tree algorithm. We used adjacency matrix representations of the input graphs. We implement the priority queue data structure needed by both algorithms using a binary min-heap and, alternatively, as a linked list, and we compare both methods.

The following libraries are required to run the project:
- pip3 install pytest 
- pip3 install matplotlib
- pip3 install tkinter
- pip3 install networkx

For an easy installation of used libraries run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


After installing the required libraries, open a terminal and make sure you are in the folder containing the Python files before entering the following command to run the program:

- python3 DrawGraph.py 

If running the test is desired:

- pytest
